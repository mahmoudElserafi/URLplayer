Effective Date: [26/06/2025]

At URL Player Ultimate, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what data the app uses, how it is stored, and your rights as a user.

🔐 What Data We Collect
We do not collect any personal information or send any data to external servers. The app does not use any form of tracking or analytics.

However, for functionality, the app may store the following locally on your device:

Video links (URLs) you enter or play

Playlists you create

Playback history and preferences

This data is only stored on your device and never shared.

🗑️ How You Control Your Data
You remain in full control of your saved data. You can:

Manually delete links, playlists, or history from within the app

Clear all app data using your device’s system settings

The app does not back up or transfer your data anywhere — once you delete it, it’s gone for good.

📱 Permissions We Use
To give you the best experience, the app may request:

Internet Access – to stream videos from URLs

Storage Access (optional) – to read/write playlist files if you choose to use that feature

We do not access your personal files or media unless you explicitly choose to interact with them via the app.

🤝 Third-Party Services
URL Player Ultimate does not use third-party services that collect or process user data, such as analytics, ad networks, or crash reporting tools.

🔄 Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be clearly reflected in the app and on our listing.
